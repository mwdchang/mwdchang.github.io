           My day job deals with <a href="https://dcc.icgc.org" target="_blank">cancer genomics</a>. 

           I designed a quite a few proof-of-concept visualizations for my team at work to explore better ways of 
           exploring and interacting with genomics data. As with most proof-of-concepts, many of these are quite rough around the edges, they are merely
           meant to illustrate an idea and serve as a starting point.

       <strong>Using Arc-Diagram for set interactions</strong>
       <p>
           We use the venerable Venn/Euler diagram to illustrate set operations; for example set of overlapped genes from two cancer types. Venn diagrams
           are easy to understand but does not scale well with the number of sets involved. Also, it is non-trivial to arrange the sets in an 
           area-propotional manner.
       </p>
       <p>

           Arc-digrams can be used in place of Venns. Each contiguous block represents set, the sub-blocks are the intersecting subsets and the arcs denotes
           the relations. Below shows the intersecting sets of Set 2.

           The key advantages are: 
           <ul>
              <li>Arc-digram scales better, we can comfortably fit 5-6 set intersections before usability becomes an issue. </li>
              <li>We don't have degenerate cases where the overlapping propotions cannot be accurated represented (with circles).</li> 
           </ul>

       <strong>Using small multiples to investigate donor traits</strong>
       <p>
           A donor has many physical and clinical traits; gender, status, age, project...etc. It can be interesting to see how one trait relates
           to another; for example what is the age distribution across different projects. I built a small-multiple prototype against production API
           as a live demonostration. Each bar chart shows the number of donors of a given trait (Dimension #1) varies across a second trait (Dimension #2), 
           with the height of the bar itself denoting the number of donors.<br>

       <strong>Visual query builder</strong>
       <p>
          I wrote a very primitive prototype to demonstrate how a visual query interface can works. Each node represents an expression/condition.
          Nodes can be combined together to form new expressions/conditions. The basic premise is to provide researchers a way to visualize and to
          track their workflow. Starting with a simple query, they can incrementally refine or widen the criteria. The DAG representation provides
          an easy way for them to review results at each step of the process, and allows the construction of complex queries.

       <strong>Metadata viewer</strong>
       <p>
          I wrote a meta data viewer because I got tired of reading the gigantic JSON document that serves as our data dictionary. The viewer
          offers several different perspectives (tabular, relational and summary), allows the users to perform a diff operation across different 
          data dictionary versions, and provides several useful searching capabilities. This ends up quite useful, as data dictionary changes 
          every release and this gives us, as well as the data submitters a good overview of what has changed
          and how to go about data migration.

       <strong>Top mutated genes with parallel coords</strong>
       <p>
           This is an attempt to redesign the stacked-bar chart that shows how the top 20 mutated genes prevail across 
           different cancer projects. Because hues are used to encode the 50+ projects, it is very difficult to read. The variances
           in the data also make it difficult to interact with the chart. <br>

           The parallel coord plot solves some of the issues listed above by:
           <ul>
               <li>Normalizing gene occurrences in a project to %-based instead of absolute values, this reduces the variances.</li>
               <li>Genes are more comparable across projects, genes can be re-arranged to see different relations</li>
               <li>Query API to highlight genes, projects and %-affected</li>
           </ul>
           <br>

           <p>Below we highlight the bone cancer projects (BOCA-FR, BOCA-UK). Note there while the two project follows similar pattern across
           the top genes, there is a noticeable disprency on the IDH1 gene</p>

       <strong>Enhanced bar chart</strong>
       <p>
           Bar charts are ubiquitous. But can we do a bit more?  <br>
           My take has the following twists:
           <img src="/images/bars.png"></img> <br>
           <ul>
               <li>A guide line showing the position on the axis when interacting with the chart, this allows one to easily compare the bars value against others. </li>
               <li>Pagination. Yep, this isn't as nice as focus-context technique, however this is more compact which was a goal at the time.</li>
           </ul>
           <p>

       <strong>Redesign project pie chart</strong>
       <p>
           An attempt to redesign the project pie chart (encoding the project size) to give more equal visibility to smaller projects. I used bubbles
           on top of force-directed layout. Project size are encoded as the area of the circles. Since I am no longer confined to 360 degrees, the small
           projects occupies more area, and are easier to both see and interact.

           Arranged by cancer primary sites, this gives a sense of how many projects, and how many total donors are available within each cancer site.
