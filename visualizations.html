           My day job deals with <a href="https://dcc.icgc.org" target="_blank">cancer genomics</a>. 

           To promote better data access and comprehension. I designed a quite a few proof-of-concept visualizations for my team at work to explore better ways of 
           exploring and interacting with genomics data. As with most proof of concepts, many of these are quite rough around the edges, they are merely
           meant to illustrate an idea.

       <strong>Using Arc-Diagram for set interactions</strong>
       <p>
           Designed to handle set-analyses and to be used in place of the more venerable Venn/Euler diagrams. The same subsets are highlighted across
           multiple encompassing sets, with the arcs acting as guides.
           <img src="/images/arcs.png"></img>
           The key advantages are: 
           <ul>
              <li>Arc-digram scales better, we can comfortably fit 5-6 set intersections before usability becomes an issue. </li>
              <li>We don't have degenerate cases where the overlapping propotions cannot be accurated represented (with circles).</li> 
           </ul>

       <strong>Using small multiples to investigate donor traits</strong>
       <p>
           A donor has many physical and clinical traits; gender, status, age...etc. In order to see how one trait reacts with another, I designed
           a small multiple bar charts to do this.<br>
           <img src="/images/smallmultiple.png"></img> <br>
           The traits are listed as dimensions, the point is to see how dimension #2 varies across unique values of dimension #1. For example one may 
           want to see how vital status varies arcoss different primary cancer sites.  <br><br>

       <strong>Visual query builder</strong>
       <p>
          I wrote a very primitive prototype to demonstrate how a visual query interface works. The basic idea is that the
          researchers may have several queries (i.e. age 40+ AND alive AND gene XYZ and gene ABC) that they are interested in. How he/she
          wants to see the cumulative results of all queries, while still keep track of the originals in order to see the impact.

       <strong>Metadata viewer</strong>
       <p>
          I wrote a meta data viewer because I got tired of reading the gigantic JSON document that serves as our data dictionary. The viewer
          offers several different perspectives (tabular, relational and summary), allows the users to perform a diff operation across different 
          data dictionary versions, and provides several useful searching capabilities. This ends up quite useful, as data dictionary changes 
          every release and this gives us, as well as the data submitters a good overview of what has changed
          and how to go about data migration.

       <strong>Top mutated genes with parallel coords</strong>
       <p>
           This is an attempt to redesign the stacked-bar chart that shows how the top 20 mutated genes prevail across 
           different cancer projects. Because hues are used to encode the 50+ projects, it is very difficult to read. The variances
           in the data also make it difficult to interact with the chart. <br>

           The parallel coord plot solves some of the issues listed above by:
           <ul>
               <li>Normalizing gene occurrences in a project to %-based instead of absolute values, this reduces the variances.</li>
               <li>Genes are more comparable across projects, genes can be re-arranged to see different relations</li>
               <li>Query API to highlight genes, projects and %-affected</li>
           </ul>
           <br>

           <p>Below we highlight the bone cancer projects (BOCA-FR, BOCA-UK). Note there while the two project follows similar pattern across
           the top genes, there is a noticeable disprency on the IDH1 gene</p>

       <strong>Enhanced bar chart</strong>
       <p>
           Bar charts are ubiquitous. But can we do a bit more?  <br>
           My take has the following twists:
           <img src="/images/bars.png"></img> <br>
           <ul>
               <li>A guide line showing the position on the axis when interacting with the chart, this allows one to easily compare the bars value against others. </li>
               <li>Pagination. Yep, this isn't as nice as focus-context technique, however this is more compact which was a goal at the time.</li>
           </ul>

       <strong>Redesign project pie chart</strong>
       <p>
           An attempt to redesign the project pie chart (encoding the project size) to give more equal visibility to smaller projects. I used bubbles
           on top of force-directed layout. Project size are encoded as the area of the circles. Since I am no longer confined to 360 degrees, the smaller
           projects are more visible and easier for the views to interact with them.
