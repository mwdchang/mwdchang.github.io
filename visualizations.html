           My day job deals with <a href="https://dcc.icgc.org" target="_blank">cancer genomics</a>. 

           To promote better data access and comprehension. I designed a quite a few proof-of-concept visualizations at work to explore better ways of 
           exploring and interacting with genomics data. As with most proof of concepts, many of these are quite rough around the edges, they are merely
           meant to illustrate an idea.

       <strong>Using Arc-Diagram for set interactions</strong>
       <p>
           Designed to handle set-analyses and to be used in place of the more venerable Venn/Euler diagrams. The same subsets are highlighted across
           multiple encompassing sets, with the arcs acting as guides.

           The key advantages are: 
           <ul>
              <li>Arc-digram scales better, we can comfortably fit 5-6 set intersections before usability becomes an issue. 
              <li>We don't have degenerate cases where the overlapping propotions cannot be accurated represented (with circles). 
           </ul>

       <strong>Using small multiples to investigate donor traits</strong>
       <p>
           A donor has many physical and clinical traits; gender, status, age...etc. In order to see how one trait reacts with another, I designed
           a small multiple bar charts to do this.
           <img src="/images/smallmultiple.png"></img> <br>
           The traits are listed as dimensions, the point is to see how dimension #2 varies across unique values of dimension #1. For example one may 
           want to see how vital status varies arcoss different primary cancer sites.  <br><br>
