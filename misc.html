        <strong>DBSCAN Visualization</strong>
        <p>
           DBSCAN (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBSCAN) is a clustering algorithm. I built this widget as a way to
           explore and understand how the parameters affect the number and size of the clusters. The two sliders controls
           the two main params: distance and minimum size. The plot and summary chart adjust accordingly when the parameters
           are changed.

        <strong>Morningstar Fund Scraper</strong>
        <p>
          I wrote this script to alleviate the hassle of checking the funds one-by-one on my bank's website in order
          to gauge the daily changes. Moreover, sometimes the fund prices are one business day behind making
          this execise flawed. This is a nodeJS based scraper that reads funds information from Morningstar and fetches
          the price detail via a JSON-configuration file.
