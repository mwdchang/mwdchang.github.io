        <strong>Orderbook Visualization</strong>
        <p>
           A library for the visualizing and analysis of "real-time" quotes and trades data. Allows the viewers to interactively
           scale across the time and price dimension to get different viewing perspectives. It alo capable of doing magic lens
           for data analysis of dynamic regions.

        <strong>DBSCAN Visualization</strong>
        <p>
           DBSCAN (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBSCAN) is a clustering algorithm. I built this widget as a way to
           explore and understand how the parameters affect the number and size of the clusters. The two sliders controls
           the two main params: distance and minimum size. The plot and summary chart adjust accordingly when the parameters
           are changed.

        <strong>Morningstar Fund Scraper</strong>
        <p>
          I wrote this script to alleviate the hassle of checking the funds one-by-one on my bank's website in order
          to gauge the daily changes. Moreover, sometimes the fund prices are one business day behind making
          this execise flawed. This is a nodeJS based scraper that reads funds information from Morningstar and fetches
          the price detail via a JSON-configuration file.
